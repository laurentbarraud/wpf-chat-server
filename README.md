## Chat app and server
- Made with WPF in C#, using MVVM model. 
- This project creates network packets, using a packet builder and a packet reader.
- A package builder inserts an opcode at the beginning, so that the package reader can determine its type. 
- Includes a list of connected users, which updates automatically when someone logs in or out.
